# Task: Implement a Python function that calculates the factorial of a given number using functional programming principles.
"""
Steps:
- Define a function called factorial that takes an integer n as input.
 
- Use recursion to implement the factorial calculation. 
  The factorial of n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers up to n.

- Apply functional programming concepts such as recursion and immutability. Avoid using loops or mutable data structures.
 
- Test your function with different input values and verify the results.
