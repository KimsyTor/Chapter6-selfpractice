# Exercise 2: Simple Random Password Generator
    # External Library: Random (for generating random characters)

# Task: Create a Python script that generates a random password of a fixed length.

"""
Steps:

- Import the random module.

- Define a function called generate_password that takes the length of the password as input.

- Inside the function, create a string containing all the characters to choose from (e.g., lowercase letters and digits).

- Use random.choice() to select characters randomly from the predefined set of characters.`

- Repeat this process to generate a password of the desired length.

- Return the generated password as a string.

- Prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password.

- Call the generate_password function with the user-provided input and display the generated password.
